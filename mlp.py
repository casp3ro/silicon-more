    """Tiny, readable demo of how character embeddings work with context.

    What this script shows, step-by-step:
    1) Read a list of names and build a character vocabulary (plus a '.' token
       to mark start/end of a name).
    2) Turn the first few names into many training examples. Each example is:
       - input: the last 3 character indices we've seen (the "context")
       - target: the index of the very next character
    3) Convert those integer indices into a small embedding lookup to get
       a numeric representation (vectors) for each character in the context.
        4) Print a few key shapes so it's easy to verify what's happening.
